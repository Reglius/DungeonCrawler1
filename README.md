# Game Engine from CS 2510, University of Nebrask at Omaha

This is my dungeon crawler game, to play go to [here](mc.dcnelabs.io:1111) and collect the keys to unblock the route!

To play the game on your local machine by compiling the code, create a server and open ```index.html```

If you make changes to components, scenes, or prefabs,  go into the game directory and run ```node build.js``` to create new modules with the required exports.
